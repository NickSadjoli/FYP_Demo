#FYP Demo of Sparse Coding Performance for Data Compression
This repo contains the scripts for demonstrating the capabilities of Sparse Coding to compress incoming real time machine data. Demonstration contains initial testing on performance of several Matching Pursuit algorithms on small mock data with varying variables (sparsity, random Gaussian white noise) to determine which one is the most suitable for Sparse Coding. 

Finally Compression_Comparison folder contains the scripts that measure the compression capability of Sparse Coding algorithm against various previously used compression methods to verify its overall performance, proving its viability as a compression method for real time machine data. Compressions are done on real time machine data that is sampled at 25.6 kHz
